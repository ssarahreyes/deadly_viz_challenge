Reality is sometimes hard to wrasp...but luckily we have data visualization tools to help us get reliable insights from our messy data :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart: :chart_with_downwards_trend:

## :wrench: __Tools__

You may use any of the following visualization libraries:

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Plotly (Cufflinks / Plotly Express / Dash)

> __NOTE:__ we encourage you to use __Plotly__ because interactive plots rules!

## :hammer: __The Challenge__

Your mission is to explore the dataset included in this repo which is filled with official data about the deaths in Spain from 1980 until 2018. As you will find out, the dataset can be better understand it with visualizations. The [__notebook__](https://github.com/potacho/deadly_viz_challenge/blob/master/notebooks/deadly_viz_challenge.ipynb) included in this repo will help you to perform the task but you must be creative as well as effective in the plot configuration process.

Your visualizations must generate insights about:

- The causes of death in Spain.

- The evolution of those causes.

- The relationship between the different causes of death and the demographics.

> __IMPORTANT:__ Analytics is not marketing. The difference is that analytics is about expanding the decision-maker’s perspective while marketing is about narrowing it. Similarly, data journalism is about capturing the interest of many people in a small way, while analytics is about serving the needs of a few people in a big way. The analyst serves their decision-maker(s) first and foremost.
